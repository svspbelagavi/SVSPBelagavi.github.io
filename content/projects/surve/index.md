# 🍽️ Surve: Bridging Surplus Food and Communities in Need

## Purpose

**Surve** is designed to connect surplus food providers with NGOs and institutions who can distribute the excess food to those in need. Our platform aims to tackle two critical issues: reducing food waste and supporting underserved communities. By helping organizations streamline food distribution, **Surve** empowers charities and institutions to make a greater impact on society.

## Target Audience

Our platform is crafted with **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)**, **charity institutions**, and **food distribution networks** in mind. These groups often face challenges in sourcing and managing food donations. **Surve** simplifies this by directly connecting surplus food providers to the institutions that can efficiently distribute it to the needy.

## Key Functionality

**Surve** provides an easy-to-use platform with the following features:
- **Connect surplus food providers** with NGOs and charity institutions.
- **Help reduce food waste** by ensuring that edible surplus food reaches those in need.
- **Support communities** by enabling quicker, more efficient distribution of resources.

## Hackathon Highlights

**Surve** was created during the **HackToFuture Hackathon** in a 24-hour coding marathon. Together with my talented teammates—**Vighnesh Nilajakar**, **Shreaysh Kulkarni**, **Vinayak Kolavankar**, and **Bhavani Kulkarni**—we developed a web-based platform that’s both impactful and easy to use.
