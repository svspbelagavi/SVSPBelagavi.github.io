Now we intend to extend our support for children with special needs at our center. We are currently setting up a state of art facility for education and training of children with special needs in the same premises. Already, a special room with the required equipment and training material is ready and being used for our in-house children identified with special needs. Soon, we intend to make this facility available for children from outside the center as well. An endeavor of this magnitude can only be taken up and completed with the co-operation and assistance of philanthropists from the society.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Donate Now","type":"page"},{"content":"The following individuals generously volunteer their time and expertise to guide and oversee the operations of Swami Vivekanand Seva Pratishthan.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/committee/","section":"Managing Committee","summary":"\u003cp style=\"text-align: center; margin-bottom: 2rem;\"\u003eThe following individuals generously volunteer their time and expertise to guide and oversee the operations of Swami Vivekanand Seva Pratishthan.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Managing Committee","type":"committee"},{"content":"\r🚀 Unleash Your Digital Potential #\rAre you ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of web development?
